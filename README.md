# PixArtTerraria
An application that allows you to create paintings on the Terraria map.

Watch the tutorial on YouTube, it will be released soon.

At the moment, a decision has been made to almost completely rework the project. After downloading the source code, you may be surprised at the unsuccessful assembly of the project, but this is normal, because our team wants to implement all its ideas and try to make it before the spring of 2024. If version 2.0 does not come out in the spring, this will mean only one thing: the project will be postponed indefinitely. An indefinite period means a period of one year or more...
## Another Programs
The program uses an API for processing spreadsheets and generating reports without using Microsoft Excel - [**Aspose Cells**](https://products.aspose.com/cells/net/).
> Most likely I will replace it later, but for now I'm very busy... There is some kind of free version for 30 days, or with a limit on the number of files. Although you may not use it, it is only used when creating an Excel table.

Work on the new version is being carried out in the beta branch.
